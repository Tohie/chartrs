# ChartRS

This library can be used for plotting basic 2D charts such as a bar, line or scatter graph

Please note, this library is nowhere near stable at the moment and likely has a few bugs
This library also requires a font file, please change the font-path in src/canvas/sdl2_canvas.rs
to point to a ttf file, n.b. you can grab some open source font like the ubuntu font if needed.

See src/main.rs for an example of how the library works. The resulting graph for the code in main.rs is shown below:
